# URI_Healthcheck
Did you know that there are modern webservers that do not have built in outage reports? I had no idea, and a friends website absolutely-specatacularly crashed every web page. I think it was a DNS change issue, but the hotfix had nothing to do with redeploying web pages to a new IP address. My solution? Build my own watchdog script.
